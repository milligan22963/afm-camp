        CAMP is currently installed but not configured with a plugin to its web slot.  This can be done by installing a snap
        with the proper "web" slot connected to this snaps plug such as:
        <p>
            snap connect afm-camp:web other-snap:web
        </p>

        Look at afm-web for an example of how the web interface slot should be configured.
